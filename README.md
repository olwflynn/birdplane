Image recognition bird plane project

An exploration into Deep Learning ----

Started a project hoping to detect whether an input image is a bird or plane inspired by David Newman and Robert Bentonâ€™s bookbased on the comic Superman. The technical discussion is outside the scope of this post but for those interested we used Keras (running Tensorflow) to train a connected model on top of a VGG16 model (pre-trained on the ImageNet database). The model was trained on 2000 images of each class (birds and planes) taken from Flickr API. We then put together a very (very!) rough Flask app on Heroku to allow us to share it
